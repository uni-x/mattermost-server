## About this folder

This folder contains some files that we use to build the `mattermost-server` using `Jenkins` and other files like privacy policy and licenses.

PRs opened against the `mattermost-server` repository will use the file called `Jenkinsfile.pr`

The `Dockerfile` in this folder (`Dockerfile.buildenv`) is the build environment for our current builds you can find the docker image to downalod [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-build-server/tags/) or build your own.
